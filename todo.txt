write readme
add comment headers everywhere:: update year, university name and link to repo
strip dependencies to singletons
remove references to my paper

convention: whenevr I write #9632 I mean a GHC bug report number
I'm using GADT syntax everywhere, even if a type is not a gadt
I'm not using prelude

no dependencies on any libraries

everything is exposed, this package is not intended to do anything useful

assuming you know singletons

focus on the proofs, not on encodings (like singletons)

agda diferences:
awkward names because there is no unicdoe, agda's syntax is more flexible
can't pattern match on implicit args because there are no implicit args
nonsenses possible using undefined
no commenon language for types and terms, which means we need to use separate functions at types and terms and together with singletons this is a mess
haskell pattern matches don't benefit from dependent types
