synopsis:           Verified implementation of weight-biased leftist heaps
description:        A verified Haskell implementation of weight-biased leftist
                    heap (WBLH) data structure. Verification is based on my
                    implementation done in Agda, which in turn is based on
                    "Why Dependent Types Matter". Weight-biased leftist heap
                    is described in Okasaki's "Purely Functional Data
                    Structures".
