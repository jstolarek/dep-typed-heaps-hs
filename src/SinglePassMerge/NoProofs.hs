-- Basic implementation of weight-biased leftist heap. No proofs    --
-- and no dependent types. Uses a single-pass merging algorithm.    --
--                                                                  --
-- Now we will modify our implementation by turning a two-pass      --
-- merging algorithm into a single-pass one. We will do this by     --
-- inlining makeT into merge. See [Single-pass merging algorithm]   --
-- for a detailed description of new algorithm. Since merge         --
-- function will be the only thing that changes we will not repeat  --
-- singleton, findMin and deleteMin functions - they are exactly    --
-- same as they were in case of two-pass merging algorithm. All     --
-- data declaration also remain the same. We will focus our         --
-- attention only on merging.                                       --

-- Note [Single-pass merging algorithm]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- New single-pass merging algorithm is a straightfowrward derivation
-- from two-pass merge. We obtain this new algorithm by inlining calls
-- to makeT. This means that merge creates a new node instead of
-- delegating this task to makeT. The consequence of this is that
-- merge has two more cases now (a total of six). Base cases remain
-- unchanged (we use the same notation as in [Two-pass merging
-- algorithm]:
--
--    a) h1 is empty - return h2
--
--    b) h2 is empty - return h1
--
-- There are two more cases in the inductive part of merge definition:
--
--    c) priority p1 is higher than p2 AND rank of l1 is not smaller
--       than rank of r1 + h2 - p1 becomes the root, l1 becomes the
--       left child and result of merging r1 with h2 becomes the right
--       child child.
--
--               p1
--              /  \
--             /    \
--            l1  r1+h2
--
--    d) priority p1 is higher than p2 AND rank of r1 + h2 is not
--       smaller than rank of l1 - p1 becomes the root, result of
--       merging r1 with h2 becomes the left child and l1 becomes the
--       right child child.
--
--               p1
--              /  \
--             /    \
--           r1+h2  l1
--
--    e) priority p2 is higher than p1 AND rank of l2 is not smaller
--       rank of r2 + h1 - p2 becomes the root, l2 becomes the left
--       child and result of merging r2 with h1 becomes the right
--       child child.
--
--               p2
--              /  \
--             /    \
--            l2  r2+h1
--
--    f) priority p2 is higher than p1 AND rank of r2 + h1 is not
--       smaller than rank of l2 - p2 becomes the root, result of
--       merging r2 with h1 becomes the left child and l2 becomes the
--       right child child.
--
--               p2
--              /  \
--             /    \
--           r2+h1  l2

-- We still use a helper function to get rank of a node
rank :: Heap -> Nat
rank Empty          = Zero
rank (Node _ r _ _) = r

-- Note [Compacting merge]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- To make implementation of merge slighty shorter we check which
-- priority is higher and at the same time we compute relation between
-- ranks of new possible subtrees (l1, r1 + h2 and l2, r2 + h1).
-- Depending on result of comparing p1 with p2 we will only need to
-- know one of this relations:
--
--   1) if priority p1 is higher than p2 then we need to know whether
--      l1 ≥ r1 + h2
--
--   2) if priority p2 is higher than p1 then we need to know whether
--      l2 ≥ r2 + h1
--
-- Computing these relations at once allows us to reduce code
-- verbosity at the price of doing some extra computations. In a
-- practical application we would most likely prefer performance over
-- code readibility, but I believe that for demonstration purposes it
-- is better to have shorter code.
